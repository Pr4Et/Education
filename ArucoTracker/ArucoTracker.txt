Suitable for pendulum and other harmonic oscillations, study collisions, camera in a non-Newtonian (accelerating/ rotating) reference frame. 

Use either live internal camera, or remote webcam camera (install IP Webcam app on your phone, start by clicking: start server),or use pre- recorded mp4 file.
The program calculates position, rotation, two-axis size, and acceleration of Aruco tags (up to two tags on first come basis),and exports data to Excel file.
To generate Aruco images: go to https://chev.me/arucogen/ and choose the 5X5 100 series with any valid ID. 
Can track any number of tags, but keeps full track of 2. Exports data to Excel.
